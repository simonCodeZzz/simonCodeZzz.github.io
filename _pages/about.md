Hi there! I am Simian (or Simon if you prefer), currently a PhD student in [Department of Information System and Analytics](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/about/depts/disa/) at [NUS School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/).

My research interests lie in analytical modelling and mechanism design for online streaming media platforms. I am also exploring opportunities to employ structural model for empirical works. If you have interesting research ideas, I would be happy to discuss with you via my email zhang.simian at u.nus.edu.

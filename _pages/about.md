Hi there! I am Simon, a Year 3 (soon-to-be Year 4) student at [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://www.nus.edu.sg/), with primary major in Data Science & Analytics and second major in Economics. 
I have lived in China for 15 years and studied in Singapore for 8 years. I have a strong interest in applying my knowledge in data science to solve problems in the real world. 
Currently, I am a Research Assistant in [Institute of Operations Research and Analytics (IORA)](https://iora.nus.edu.sg/) under supervision of [Prof. Jussi Keppo](https://www.jussikeppo.com/).

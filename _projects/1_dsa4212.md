* Led a team of 4 to explore impacts of different image processing procedures and optimization algorithms on large-scale image classification with best test accuracy of 0.93 and AUC of 0.97
* Implemented framework of multi-class logistic regression and SGD variance reduction algorithms from scratch in Jax and investigated their empirical performance on large-scale data sets
* Achieved faster convergence rate and lower computation cost compared to baseline algorithm
